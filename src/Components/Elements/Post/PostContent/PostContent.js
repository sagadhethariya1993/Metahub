            Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. In 2014, development was
            crowdfunded, and the network went live with an initial supply of 72 million coins on 30 July
            2015. The platform allows developers to build and operate decentralized applications that users
            can interact with. Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial
            services without the need for typical financial intermediaries, such as brokerages, exchanges,
            or banks, allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for or
            lend them out for interest. Ethereum also allows for the creation and exchange of NFTs, which
            are non-interchangeable tokens connected to digital works of art or other real-world items and
            sold as unique digital property. Additionally, many other cryptocurrencies operate as ERC-20
            tokens on top of the Ethereum blockchain and have utilized the platform for initial coin
            offerings.
            Ethereum has started implementing a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0, which includes a
            transition to proof of stake and aims to increase transaction throughput using sharding.

          <p>A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unit of data stored on a digital ledger, called a blockchain,
            that certifies a digital asset to be unique and therefore not interchangeable. NFTs can be used
            to represent items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files. Access to
            any copy of the original file, however, is not restricted to the buyer of the NFT. While copies
            of these digital items are available for anyone to obtain, NFTs are tracked on blockchains to
            provide the owner with a proof of ownership that is separate from copyright. </p>

          <p>NFTs function like cryptographic tokens, but unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, are not
            mutually interchangeable, in other words, not fungible (e.g. one bitcoin is equivalent to any
            other bitcoin while every NFT may represent a different underlying asset and thus have a
            different value). NFTs are created when blockchains string records of cryptographic hash, a set
            of characters identifying a set of data, onto previous records therefore creating a chain of
            identifiable data blocks. This cryptographic transaction process ensures the authentication of
            each digital file by providing a digital signature that is used to track NFT ownership. However,
            data links that point to details like where the art is stored can die. The unique identity and
            ownership of an NFT is verifiable via the blockchain ledger</p>

          <p>Digital art was an early use case for NFTs, because of the ability of blockchain technology to
            assure the unique signature and ownership of NFTs.</p>

          <p>The unique identity and ownership of an NFT is verifiable via the blockchain ledger. Ownership of
            the NFT is often associated with a license to use the underlying digital asset, but generally
            does not confer copyright to the buyer: some agreements only grant a license for personal,
            non-commercial use, while other licenses also allow commercial use of the underlying digital
            asset.</p>
